# Text Interface

This is a simple text interface to define and query knowledge bases.
There are two ways to run this demo:

* You can run it in your browser:
  <http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cschwering/demo/textinterface/>.
* You can compile and run it in the terminal; input is read from stdin then:
  run `make` and then `./ti <example-1.txt`.
